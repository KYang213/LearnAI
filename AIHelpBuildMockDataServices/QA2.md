[Me] how to build the deployment package for this project to run in a new windows server that do not have internet connection?

[python]: To deploy this FastAPI project on a Windows server without internet access, you'll need to create an offline deployment package that includes all necessary files and dependencies. Here’s a step-by-step guide to prepare the package and deploy it on the server:

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies
First, create a virtual environment and install the required packages on a machine with internet access.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Freeze the Installed Packages
Create a `requirements.txt` file with all the dependencies.

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download the Dependencies
Use `pip` to download the required packages into a local directory.

```bash
mkdir packages
pip download -r requirements.txt -d packages
```

### Step 4: Prepare the Deployment Package
Create a deployment package that includes the project files, the `venv`, and the downloaded packages.

```bash
mkdir deployment_package
cp -r data deployment_package/data
cp main.py deployment_package/
cp requirements.txt deployment_package/
cp -r packages deployment_package/packages
cp -r venv deployment_package/venv
```

### Step 5: Transfer the Deployment Package to the Server
Transfer the `deployment_package` directory to the target Windows server. You can use a USB drive, FTP, or any other file transfer method.

### Step 6: Set Up the Environment on the Server
On the Windows server, set up the environment using the transferred files.

1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   ```cmd
   cd path\to\deployment_package
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install the Dependencies:**
   ```cmd
   pip install --no-index --find-links=packages -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 7: Run the FastAPI Application
Start the FastAPI server on the Windows server.

```cmd
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Recap of Deployment Package Structure
Ensure that the `deployment_package` directory has the following structure before transferring it to the server:

```
deployment_package/
│
├── data/
│   ├── example1.json
│   ├── example2.json
│   └── ...
│
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
├── packages/
│   ├── fastapi-0.68.1-py3-none-any.whl
│   ├── uvicorn-0.15.0-py3-none-any.whl
│   └── ...
│
└── venv/
    ├── Scripts/
    ├── Lib/
    └── ...
```

This setup ensures that all dependencies and the environment are self-contained, allowing the application to run on a server without internet access.
