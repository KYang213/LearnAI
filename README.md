# LearnAI

##Suggestions of learn AI
- Transformer - if interesting to learn the AI module
  - Today's large models are all a type of neural network called transformer.
	- If you want to understand transformer, read the original paper, 
	and then google transformer on YouTube, there are various special explanations.
- If interest to learn how to use AI
  - learn pytorch, huggingface, langchain.  Google related tutorial. 
	- read related paper and source code.
- The fastest way to understand the architecture or locate bugs is to read the source code.
